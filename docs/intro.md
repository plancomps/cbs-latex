# Introduction

The [Local browsing] page explains how the PDFs and web pages were produced using `kramdown`, `pdflatex`, and `jekyll`.

The [Macros] page explains how to mark up CBS specifications in LaTeX when using the `cbs-latex` package.
It also provides links to the macro definitions for use with LaTeX, KaTeX, and MathJax.

The [Samples] page links to marked-up CBS specifications, and to the results of formatting them to produce PDFs and web pages.

The [Issues] page on GitHub is to list known problems with the quality of PDFs and web pages when using `cbs-latex`.
