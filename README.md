# CBS-LaTeX

This site presents `cbs-latex`, a small LaTeX package for CBS specifications.
When CBS is marked up using the package, LaTeX formatting produces mathematical
typography, suitable for inclusion in published articles.

It also includes [KaTeX](https://katex.org) and [MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org)
configurations that produce similar-looking results from the same LaTeX mark-up
when embedded in web pages.
